Computer science too challenging, so let's consider switching to information management. 
In this test, there are a total of five questions, and each question is worth '10 points' for Programming Skill. However, be aware that the Liver Index will increase by 3 points, and the Lazy Index will also increase by 1 point. You'll have to earn all the points on your own!
Programming Skill += Number of correct answers * 10, Liver Index += Number of correct answers * 3, Lazy Index += Number of correct answers * 1
